# Library Management System (LMS) - Android App

This **Library Management System (LMS)** is an Android application built using **Java** and **SQLite**, designed to help libraries efficiently manage their books and users. The app provides two key roles: **Admin** and **User**.

## Features:
- **Admin Panel**:
  - Add, update, delete, and issue books.
  - View issued books, manage fines, and return books.
- **User Panel**:
  - Search for available books.
  - View issued books, reissue books, and check return deadlines.
  
## Technical Details:
- **SQLite Database** for offline storage of books and user details.
- **Cloud Integration** for real-time synchronization (planned feature).
- **Push Notifications** for new book additions, fine updates, and approaching return deadlines.
- **Security Rules** implemented for database protection and access control.

The app uses a clean, minimal layout with buttons and text fields for easy interaction. The Admin can add books and manage users, while users can browse and manage their book checkouts.
